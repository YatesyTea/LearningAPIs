# LearningAPIs
The intent of this repository is for learning and reinforcing knowledge of Restful APIs.

# Steps
The first step is to do some background research (sources will be listed at bottom).

Secondly I'll be experimenting with FastAPI, and / or NodeJS with APIs to see how they'll work.

I'll be using this in other projects down the line, but a quick way of learning the technology is required.
